## Usage

This project has been built around running on Vercel, but with some work it should run on Express or any other Node.js server.

Currently four of HoYoVerses' games are supported: Honkai Impact 3rd, Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail and Zenless Zone Zero. Each are accessed with the same URL but with a different "game" parameter.

| Game              | URL                            | Parameter |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| Honkai Impact 3rd | /api/v1/getCard?game=honkai3rd | honkai3rd |
| Genshin Impact    | /api/v1/getCard?game=genshin   | genshin   |
| Honkai: Star Rail | /api/v1/getCard?game=starrail  | starrail  |
| Zenless Zone Zero | /api/v1/getCard?game=zzz       | zzz       |

#### 3. Deploying to Vercel

Before you deploy to Vercel you'll need to create a new project and link it to your GitHub repository. You'll then need to add the following environment variables:

| Variable        | Description                                                                                                       | Optional | Example                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| HOYOLAB_TOKENV2 | If the cookie you copied from HoYoLAB includes "ltoken_v2" at the start then set this to `true`, otherwise set this to `false`. | Yes      | `true`                   |
| HOYOLAB_TOKEN   | The value of the "ltoken" or "ltoken_v2" cookie.                                                                  | No       | `aXDNHHbL8FVbvbv1d4AVuD` |
| HOYOLAB_ID      | The value of the "ltuid" or "ltuid_v2" cookie.                                                                    | No       | `123456789`              |

![deploy-2.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joshua-Noakes1/mei-cards/main/.github/images/deploy-2.png)

#### 4. Using the API

You can now use the API by sending a GET request to the URL of your Vercel project with the game parameter set to the game you want to get the card for.

| Game              | URL                            | Parameter |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| Honkai Impact 3rd | /api/v1/getCard?game=honkai3rd | honkai3rd |
| Genshin Impact    | /api/v1/getCard?game=genshin   | genshin   |
| Honkai: Star Rail | /api/v1/getCard?game=starrail  | starrail  |
| Zenless Zone Zero | /api/v1/getCard?game=zzz       | zzz       |

## Swapping the backgrounds

If you want to use a different image as the background for your selected game you can do so by replacing the image in the `lib/hoyo/images` folder. The image should be a 2400x1200 JPG file.

For example, if you wanted to change the background for Honkai: Star Rail you would replace the `starrail.jpg` file with your new image.
